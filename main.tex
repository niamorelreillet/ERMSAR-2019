\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This work pertains to the modeling of in-vessel corium pool within the framework of Severe Accident studies for Light Water Reactors (LWRs). Considering in particular ``In-Vessel Retention'' (IVR) safety strategies, a key element is the phenomenology associated with a corium pool that can be formed after the loss of the primary coolant and the induced core degradation. Indeed, the heat flux from the corium pool to the vessel wall determines the chances of success of a reactor pit reflooding strategy (``External Reactor Vessel Cooling'' ERVC). The behavior of a corium pool results from the combination of two main types of phenomena. While, the associated thermochemistry defines the segregation of the pool in different phases (both liquid and solid), thermohydraulics finally determines through natural convection (that may be laminar or turbulent depending on the size) the heat flux at the pool interface.

In this context, code cross-comparisons \cite{Bakouta2015} performed by CEA and EDF on the stratified in-vessel corium pool models of PROCOR (CEA, see \cite{LeTellier2015}) and EDF proprietary versions of MAAP4 \cite{maap4} and MAAP5 \cite{maap5} (indistinctly referred to as MAAP-EDF in the remainder) have shown that an important source of discrepancy is related to the associated thermodynamic representation of the sub-oxidized corium-steel system. The PIRT (Phenomena Identification Ranking Table, see \cite{Carenini2019a}) developed in the frame of the H2020 European project IVMR (In-Vessel Melt Retention) has also pointed out the prime importance of gaining knowledge for a more detailed modeling of the thermochemical peculiarities (e.g. liquid miscibility gap) of the corium-steel system. Indeed, the modeling of corium-steel thermochemical interactions in codes treating of in-vessel corium behavior is rather recent\footnote{For instance, first efforts for constructing transient stratification models can be traced back to the OECD MASCA program in the early 2000's \cite{Tsurikov2007}.} and is still very incomplete \cite{Carenini2018}. In particular, the recent results of the CORDEB experimental program \cite{Almjashev2018} have clearly shown the requirement for further studies regarding the thermochemical interactions between molten steel and suboxidized corium crust. 

In addition to thermochemical modeling aspects related to phase-component partitioning (e.g. for the liquid phases and the related phase stratification), such thermodynamic information is needed for the closures of thermal models, in particular in terms of enthalpy-temperature relations as a function of the composition for energy conservation equations.

As thermochemical models are introduced in codes that historically dealt only with corium thermalhydraulics, an issue is raised pertaining to the consistency of the corium-steel system thermodynamic representation underlying the different models or closures. In the case of the MAAP-EDF code, it was shown in \cite{Bakouta2015} that the native MAAP ``Equation-Of-State'' (EOS) that provides the closures (the specific enthalpy, the liquidus temperature and so on for a given material composition) to energy balance equations written in enthalpy is inconsistent with the findings of the MASCA project regarding corium-steel thermochemical interactions and, consequently, with the liquid phases stratification model proposed in \cite{LeTellier2014} and introduced in MAAP-EDF. It leads to erroneous temperatures at the interface between the liquid corium pool layers and the surrounding oxidic crust. 

In order to solve this consistency issue, a single, as exhaustive as possible, thermodynamic representation of the system should be used throughout all the different models and closures. Severe accident dedicated thermodynamic databases constructed by the CALPHAD method \cite{Lukas2007} offer such a representation. Actually, various thermochemical models that are used for in-vessel corium behavior are based in one way or the other on thermodynamical description of the corium system through databases obtained with the CALPHAD approach. Such databases are constructed in terms of mathematical models (with adjustable parameters fitted on experimental data \cite{Barrachin2004, Gueneau2015}) that represent the Gibbs energy of the different phases for low-order systems (in practice, binary and ternary systems). This information, through extrapolation, is used to calculate the Gibbs energy of higher-order systems in such a way that these databases, combined with a Gibbs energy minimizer code, can be used to calculate the thermodynamical properties of a system at isothermal equilibrium. Gibbs energy phase models in such databases also offer the possibility of extrapolating outside the thermodynamic stability range and consequently can be used in kinetic modeling of phase transformations.

In \cite{Tiwari2018}, as a first step towards a CALPHAD-based EOS for in-vessel corium, a preliminary study was carried out on a simple plane front solidification model for the ternary U-O-Zr system and the results have confirmed the feasibility of using the CALPHAD database to obtain thermodynamically consistent closures for the conservation equations. 

In this preliminary work, two major ``simplifications'' were made and require further analysis. On the one hand, under the hypotheses of this solidification model, both liquid and solid regions are monophasic in such a way that they can be directly related to the phases described in the CALPHAD database. In the general case, CALPHAD data should be supplemented by phase segregation hypotheses and models for the construction of the desired EOS. %It should be emphasized that these hypotheses should be made, as far as possible, consistent with in-vessel corium associated thermochemical models to which the thermal balance is coupled with. 
On the other hand, this solidification model, from the point of view of CALPHAD-derived quantities (including thermodynamic equilibria), makes direct use of a Gibbs energy minimizing code (the Open-Calphad code as interfaced in PROCOR, see \cite{Sundman2016}). Considering the complete modeling of in-vessel corium, for the sake of robustness and performances, this direct approach appears impractical. As a consequence, tabulation and interpolation strategies regarding the CALPHAD-based thermodynamic properties (e.g. \cite{Saad2015}) have to be envisaged.

This paper is focused on these two differents aspects associated with the consistent and practical use of CALPHAD data for in-vessel corium pool modeling.
First, different segregation hypotheses that can be made when constructing such an EOS are discussed and analyzed in \Sect{analytical} for the steel-corium system on a simple test case. Then, \Sect{practical} reports ongoing developments regarding the sampling, storage and interpolation of CALPHAD-based thermodynamic properties for the EOS construction. Conclusions and perspectives are proposed in \Sect{concl}.

In this second part of the paper, some considerations regarding the tabulation and interpolation strategies of CALPHAD-based thermodynamic properties for in-vessel corium are presented. As mentioned in the introduction, the ``mock-up'' model discussed in \cite{Tiwari2018} for the solidification for the ternary U-O-Zr system makes direct use of the Open-Calphad code. This direct approach raises two issues. 

First of all, the computational time associated with a Gibbs energy minimizing code may not be compatible with the requirements on execution time of the lumped parameter modeling for in-vessel corium. While parallel computing (in shared memory as reported in \cite{Sundman2016} for Open-Calphad) can be a valuable option for distributed parameters models (see, for instance, \cite{Introini2018} for the use of Open-Calphad in a nuclear fuel performance code), the associated benefits for lumped parameter models, that are typically used for Monte-Carlo based statistical study, is less clear. 

Then, considering the U-O-Zr-steel system, the peculiarities of its phase diagram (in particular, the liquid miscibility gap) can induce convergence issues (either non-convergence or misconvergence) when minimizing the Gibbs energy in order to calculate a thermodynamic equilibrium. Such a phenomenon was typically observed when producing the results depicted at \Fig{x-T_C32_1850}. More particularly, the root-finding problem associated with \Eq{t(h)} is solved by an iterative algorithm (Brent type) that can fail due to misconvergence in the underlying equilibrium calculations (e.g. ``flickering'' of the phases found at equilibrium in a limited temperature range). In the present study, such problems have reccurently appeared in the region where the two liquid phases and the solid face-centered cubic (U,Zr)O$_{2-x}$ phase phases coexist. A strategy based on the comparison of the Gibbs energy values obtained from equilibrium calculations with different parameters (in terms of miscibility gap treatment, database phases that are considered in the calculation and so on) for given composition and temperature have been used and was found successful to obtain the results of \Fig{x-T_C32_1850}. However, such a strategy increases the overall computational time and, in other cases, was not able to ensure convergence.

As a consequence, in the MAAP-EDF and PROCOR codes, tabulation and interpolation strategies regarding the CALPHAD-based thermodynamic properties have been envisaged and are under development. Taking into account the convergence issue that have just been discussed, a general dynamic interpolation scheme such as the one proposed in \cite{Larsson2015} has not been retained. From there, considering a ``static'' interpolation (where all interpolation points have been precalculated), one is faced, in the general case,  with a ``curse of dimensionality'' issue as the size of the variable space scales with the power of the number of components. 

However, in the framework of in-vessel corium modeling, this very general issue can be mitigated by:
\begin{itemize}
 \item reducing the ranges of compositions and temperature to the domain of interest for the associated corium models;
 \item adopting a adaptive-mesh refinement strategy for the construction of the interpolation grid.
\end{itemize}
More particularly, from the point of view of equilibrium calculations (whose input variables are $\left(\elementMassFraction[i]{}\right)_{i\in\elementSet}$, the element mass fractions and $\temperature{}$, the temperature), in-vessel models requires data for a temperature ranging from $\Mc{T}_{liq}\left(\elementMassFraction[i]{}\right)_{i\in\elementSet}$ to $\Mc{T}_{liq}\left(\elementMassFraction[i]{}\right)_{i\in\elementSet} + \Delta\temperature{}$ with $\Delta\temperature{}$ limited to a few hundreds of degrees.
